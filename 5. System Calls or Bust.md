This section goes over system calls. When one these is called, the kernel takes over and does the work for you.
>`man` pages don't help with what order you should call them in

>many code snippets in this guide don't have the necessary error checking that you should have. e.g. `getaddrinfo()` is assumed to succeed and return a valid entry in the linked list.

NOTE DOWN WHEN A STANDALONE PROGRAM IS BEING SHOWN AND MENTION THAT IT HAS THE NECESSARY ERROR CHECKING

# `getaddrinfo()`
This function does a lot, but using it is simple.
- DNS and service name lookups
>In the past, `gethostbyname()` was used to do a DNS lookup. Then, information was manually loaded into `struct sockaddr_in`

DNS (Domain Name System): protocol that translates human readable domain names into machine readable IP addresses. e.g. www\.amazon.com -> `192.0.2.44`

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>

int getaddrinfo(const char *node,     // e.g. "www.example.com" or IP
                const char *service,  // e.g. "http" or port number
                const struct addrinfo *hints,
                struct addrinfo **res);
```
- `node`: a host name or IP address
- `service`: a port number (e.g. 80) or name of a particular service (e.g. "http", "ftp", "telnet", "smtp", etc.)
- `hints`: pointer to a `struct addrinfo` that you've already filled out with relevant information(?)
	- pointer to a `struct addrinfo` that specifies:
		- IPv4/IPv6/version agnostic. 
		- Stream or data socket. This specifies the type of socket that will be used to connect
		- ai_flags not explained yet
- `res` ?? EXPLAIN THIS MORE. why double pointer?

- Returns `0` if successful. Otherwise, returns an integer that represents an error code. List of all error codes in "RETURN" VALUE" section of  [[https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html|man]].

gives you a pointer to a linked-list, `res`, of the results

Example code to listen to port 3490 of your host's IP address:
```c
int status;
struct addrinfo hints;
struct addrinfo *servinfo;  // will point to the results

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints); // make sure the struct is empty
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;     // don't care IPv4 or IPv6
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // TCP stream sockets
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // fill in my IP for me

if ((status = getaddrinfo(NULL, "3490", &hints, &servinfo)) != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo error: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
    exit(1);
}

// servinfo now points to a linked list of 1 or more struct addrinfos

// ... do everything until you don't need servinfo anymore ....

freeaddrinfo(servinfo); // free the linked-list
```
[[C#Assignment Expression|What is going on in that if statement?]]
- `status` is used to hold the return value of `getaddrinfo()`
- `hints` is used for hints
- `servinfo` points to results from `getaddrinfo()`. This is where the main information is.
1. Declare the 3 variables
2. clear out `hint`'s data since it, like any other declared but uninitialized variable, should be cleared out to get rid of garbage data and avoid undefined behavior.
3. Set it as: version agnostic, uses stream sockets, `AI_PASSIVE`
	The `AI PASSIVE` flag does nothing unless it is combined with `node` set to `NULL`. This sets the address of my local host to the socket structures. This is the same as setting `node` to your local host's network address manually.
4. Put the information into `servinfo`. Implement error checking by storing the return value in `status` and printing it out 
		`gai_strerror()` is a function specifically for `getaddrinfo()`. It turns the `int` returned by `getaddrinfo()` and turns it into its corresponding error message in human-readable form.
5. After using `getaddrinfo()`, `servinfo` will point to a linked list of `sockaddr` structures.
6. Finally, free the linked list using `freeaddrinfo(servinfo)` so that the linked list no longer takes up any data.
The goal of this code is to put a linked list of `struct addrinfo`'s into `servinfo`. Each `struc` will have network address information corresponding to port 3490 on the local machine (since first argument is null).
If `getaddrinfo("www.google.com", "3490", ...)` was used instead, it would give IP addresses for port 3490 on Google's side.

From the [manual](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html)
>If the **AI_PASSIVE** flag is specified in _hints.ai_flags_, and _node_ is 
>NULL, then the returned socket addresses will be suitable for
>[bind(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html)ing a socket that will [accept(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/accept.2.html) connections.  The returned
>socket address will contain the "wildcard address" (**INADDR_ANY** for
>IPv4 addresses, **IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT** for IPv6 address).  The wildcard
>address is used by applications (typically servers) that intend to
>accept connections on any of the host's network addresses.  If
>_node_ is not NULL, then the **AI_PASSIVE** flag is ignored.

In summary, this example demonstrates how to use `getaddrinfo()` to set up structures. Each structure contains an internet address to be used with `bind()` or `connect()`

The following example is exactly the same as the previous example except the server is hardcoded in instead of using our local host. Same port number too.
```c
int status;
struct addrinfo hints;
struct addrinfo *servinfo;  // will point to the results

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints); // make sure the struct is empty
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;     // don't care IPv4 or IPv6
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // TCP stream sockets

// get ready to connect
status = getaddrinfo("www.example.net", "3490", &hints, &servinfo);
```
Also, this lacks error checking for if `getaddrinfo()` fails.
Other than this, the only difference is the first argument of `getaddrinfo()` and the `ai.flags` attribute is not set.

Example program that prints all IP addresses of a given host given as the 2nd command line argument.
```c
/*
** showip.c -- show IP addresses for a host given on the command line
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct addrinfo hints, *res, *p;
    int status;
    char ipstr[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN];

    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr,"usage: showip hostname\n");
        return 1;
    }

    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
    hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; // AF_INET or AF_INET6 to force version
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;

    if ((status = getaddrinfo(argv[1], NULL, &hints, &res)) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
        return 2;
    }

    printf("IP addresses for %s:\n\n", argv[1]);

    for(p = res;p != NULL; p = p->ai_next) {
        void *addr;
        char *ipver;

        // get the pointer to the address itself,
        // different fields in IPv4 and IPv6:
        if (p->ai_family == AF_INET) { // IPv4
            struct sockaddr_in *ipv4 = (struct sockaddr_in *)p->ai_addr;
            addr = &(ipv4->sin_addr);
            ipver = "IPv4";
        } else { // IPv6
            struct sockaddr_in6 *ipv6 = (struct sockaddr_in6 *)p->ai_addr;
            addr = &(ipv6->sin6_addr);
            ipver = "IPv6";
        }

        // convert the IP to a string and print it:
        inet_ntop(p->ai_family, addr, ipstr, sizeof ipstr);
        printf("  %s: %s\n", ipver, ipstr);
    }

    freeaddrinfo(res); // free the linked list

    return 0;
}
```
1. Declare `hints`, `res`, `p`. The latter 2 are `struct addrinfo` pointers.
	1. `res` will point to the linked list of `struc addrinfo`'s from `getaddrinfo()`
	2. `p` will be used to iterate through the linked list
2. `ipstr` is a character array of `IP6_ADDSTRLEN` elements since we don't know if IPv4 or IPv6 are used in, so the smallest value that can hold either one is chosen
3. Give an error message if there are not 2 arguments, set up `hints` and use `getaddrinfo()` to put get linked list of `struc`s as usual
4. Use a `for` loop to loop through the linked list
	1. Declare `addr` and `ipver`
		1. `addr` will point to a `struc in_addr` using `sin_addr`.
		2. `ipver` is a string that will denote the IP version. Either `"IPv4"` or `"IPv6`
	2. Check the IP version of the current `struc`.
	3. Get the `sockaddr_in` or `sockaddr_in6` by initializing a pointer that is set to the `struc addrinfo`'s `ai_addr` field.
	4. Use the pointer from the previous step to set `addr` and `ipver`
	5. Use `inet_ntop()` to convert the IP address to a human readable format to print out the IP version and address
5. Free the linked list
This has error checking implemented

Sample runs:
```
$ showip www.example.net
IP addresses for www.example.net:

  IPv4: 192.0.2.88
```
```
$ showip ipv6.example.com
IP addresses for ipv6.example.com:

  IPv4: 192.0.2.101
  IPv6: 2001:db8:8c00:22::171
```

# `socket()` to get the File Descriptor!
```c
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol); 
```
- `domain` chooses IPv4 or IPv6
	- `PF_INET` for IPv4
		- `PF_INET` is pretty much the same thing as `AF_INET`. In fact, `AF_INET` can be used here instead to do the exact same thing (specify IPv4), but it is technically more correct to use `PF_INET`. The only reason `PF_INET` was made was to prepare for features that didn't end up happening.
	- `PF_INET6` for IPv6
- `type` is the socket type
	- `SOCK_STREAM` for stream socket
	- `SOCK_DGRAM` for datagram socket
- `protocol` specifies the protocol. However, some protocol-socket combinations are not compatible. e.g. stream sockets cannot use UDP. Also, it is often optional to specify a protocol; use `0` as the argument to let the system choose the default protocol (e.g. TCP for `SOCK_STREAM` or UPD for `SOCK_DGRAM`). 
	- The protocol is just an integer. [`getprotobyname(const char* name)`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=functions-getprotobyname-get-protocol-entry-by-name) can be used to get the integer for a given protocol (i.e. the protocol number).  It returns a  pointer to a[`struc`](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/qnx_4.25_docs/tcpip50/prog_guide/libs/protoent.html) whose `p_proto` field has the protocol number. Example usage:
		`int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, getprotobyname("tcp")->p_proto);`
		- Use `"udp"` to get the protocol number for UDP instead.
- Returns a **socket descriptor** that can be used for later system calls or `-1` on error.

To use this function, put info from `getaddrinfo()` into it:
```c
int s;
struct addrinfo hints, *res;

// do the lookup
// [pretend we already filled out the "hints" struct]
getaddrinfo("www.example.com", "http", &hints, &res);

// again, you should do error-checking on getaddrinfo(), and walk
// the "res" linked list looking for valid entries instead of just
// assuming the first one is good (like many of these examples do).
// See the section on client/server for real examples.

s = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);
```
For quick reference:
- `ai_family` is `AF_INET`, `AF_INET6`, or `AF_UNSPEC`
- `ai_socktype` is `SOCK_STREAM` or `SOCK_DGRAM`
- `ai_protocol`  is the protocol

Thus, all `socket()` does is prepare a socket and give you its file descriptor associated with that socket for later use.

# `bind()`
This function is used to associate a socket with a port on your local machine. This is necessary since when an incoming packet is received, the kernel uses the port number from the packet to match it to a certain process's socket descriptor. Example:
1. I have 2 processes running on my local machine; both are web servers listening on port 80.
2. An incoming packet is received. I want this packet to go to Web Server 1.
3. The kernel gets the destination port (port 80) from the packet, but there are multiple processes listening on port 80.
4. Thus, it can't just be sent to port 80, so `bind()` is needed. Web Server 1 uses a specific socket (obtained from `socket()`), and `bind()` associates that socket with port 80, that socket's socket descriptor can be used to specify which process on port 80 receives the data.

- Each port can have multiple sockets of different types. Each use of `bind()` associates 1 socket with a port
- A process is an instance of a running program. e.g. a **server process** might be a web server like Apache listening on port 80 for HTTP
Thus, `bind()` is usually only needed if you are a server since the client needs to know where to connect to. e.g. a web browser usually connects to port 80. If the web server didn't use `bind()` to listen to port 80, the client would need to know what port was being used instead to know where to send packet.
>The kernel is the part of a computer's OS that controls interactions between software and hardware.

>An instance of a program is a a single, running copy of a program currently executing on a computer. E.g. one instance of Fortnite.
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *my_addr, int addrlen);
```
- `sockfd` is the socket file descriptor returned by `socket()`
- `my_addr` is a pointer to a `struct sockaddr` that contains information about your address. Specifically, port and IP address.
- `addrlen` is the length in bytes of your IP address (port not included)
- On error, returns `-1` and sets `errno`(?) to the error's value.
Thus, the only information `bind()` receives is your port/IP address and a socket descriptor to associate them together.

Example of binding a socket to the host the program is running on, port 3490
```c
struct addrinfo hints, *res;
int sockfd;

// first, load up address structs with getaddrinfo():

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;  // use IPv4 or IPv6, whichever
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // fill in my IP for me

getaddrinfo(NULL, "3490", &hints, &res);

// make a socket:

sockfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);

// bind it to the port we passed in to getaddrinfo():

bind(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);
```
- port 3490 is just an arbitrary port number. 
1. get information from `getaddrinfo()`. See previous example for what this does.
2. make a socket
3. bind the socket to a specific port

However, `getaddrinfo()` was introduced in POSIX.1-2001, so older code manually pack the `struct sockaddr_in`. Example:
```c
// !!! THIS IS THE OLD WAY !!!

int sockfd;
struct sockaddr_in my_addr;

sockfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

my_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
my_addr.sin_port = htons(MYPORT);     // short, network byte order
my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("10.12.110.57");
memset(my_addr.sin_zero, '\0', sizeof my_addr.sin_zero);

bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&my_addr, sizeof my_addr);
```
Notable differences:
- `socket()` arguments are manually coded in
- `MYPORT` is just a variable that holds a port number; not from a library.
	- It should be defined earlier in the user's code. e.g. `#define MYPORT 3490`
	- info on `inet_addr()` in [[3. IP Addresses, structs and Data Munging|here]]
- `my_addr` needs to be typecasted to a `struct sockaddr` and `sizeof` is used to get address length
If the code wanted your local IP address instead, the `s_addr` field will look like this:
`my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY`
- `INADDR_ANY` is for IPv4
- For IPv6, use a `struct sockaddr_in6` instead and set its `sin6_addr` field to `in6addr_any`
	- There is also a macro `IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT` that you can use in a variable initializer(??)
- This is just like using `AI_PASSIVE` flag in `hints`

Remember, all ports below 1024 are reserved unless you're the superuser. Use any ports above that to 65535 that aren't already be used by another program

# `setsockopt()`
Sometimes when you try to rerun a server, `bind()` will fail claiming "Address already in use". This is caused by a little bit(?) of a socket still being connected and is hanging around(?) in the kernel and hogging the port. It will clear after waiting for a minute. Alternatively, add the following code to allow the port to be reused:
```c
int yes=1;
//char yes='1'; // Solaris people use this

// lose the pesky "Address already in use" error message
if (setsockopt(listener,SOL_SOCKET,SO_REUSEADDR,&yes,sizeof yes) == -1) {
    perror("setsockopt");
    exit(1);
} 
```
There is no explanation of this code.

If you are trying to connect to a remote machine using `connect()`, and you don't care what your local port is(?)(e.g. `telnet` only cares about the remote port), you don't have to call `bind()`. Just call `connect()` and it will check if the socket is unbound, and will `bind()` to an unused local port if necessary.
# `connect()`
Used to establish a connection(?) to a server. The desired information from the server gets sent to a local port chosen by the kernel.

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int connect(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *serv_addr, int addrlen); 
```
- `sockfd` is the socket descriptor returned by `socket()`
- `serv_addr` is just a `struct sockaddr`, which just holds port/IP address
- `addrlen` the length in bytes of your IP address - just like in `bind()`
- Returns `-1` on error and sets `errno`

Example code to make a socket connection(?) to `www.example.com` on port 3490 (their side)
```c
struct addrinfo hints, *res;
int sockfd;

// first, load up address structs with getaddrinfo():

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;

getaddrinfo("www.example.com", "3490", &hints, &res);

// make a socket:

sockfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);

// connect!

connect(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);
```
1. use `getaddrinfo()` to get the port/IP address from `example.com` on port `3490`
2. make a socket
3. `connect()` using info from previous 2 steps

# `listen()`
Used to wait for incoming connections.
```c
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog); 
```
- `sockfd` is from `socket()`. Must be bound to a port so data can be sent there.
- `backlog` is the number of incoming connects that can be in the queue. They wait in there until they're `accept()`'d. Usually set to 5 to 128.
- Returns `-1`on error and sets `errno`

Should use these functions:
```c
getaddrinfo();
socket();
bind();
listen();
/* accept() goes here */ 
```
`getaddrinfo()` used to get local machine's IP address to use in `socket()` and `bind()`. Then call `listen()`

# `accept()`
While `listen()`'ing, incoming connections wait in the queue to be `accept()`'d. This gets the pending connection and returns a new socket descriptor for this specfiic connection. Thus, the socket descriptor used for `listen()`'ing remains and the new one will be used with `send()` and `recv()`.
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen); 
```
- `sockfd` is the socket descriptor used in `listen()` to distinguish with `listen()`'s queue to accept from
- `addr` will usually be a pointer to a `struct sockaddr_storage`- This is where the information about the incoming connection will go (and with it you can determine which host is calling you from which port)
- `addrlen` is a local integer variable that should be set to `sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage)` before its address is passed to `accept()`. `accept()` will not put more than that many bytes into `addr`. If it puts fewer in, it’ll change the value of `addrlen` to reflect that.
- Returns the socket descriptor of the incoming connection or `-1` on error and sets `errno`

Example code:
```c
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>

#define MYPORT "3490"  // the port users will be connecting to
#define BACKLOG 10     // how many pending connections queue will hold

int main(void)
{
    struct sockaddr_storage their_addr;
    socklen_t addr_size;
    struct addrinfo hints, *res;
    int sockfd, new_fd;

    // !! don't forget your error checking for these calls !!

    // first, load up address structs with getaddrinfo():

    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
    hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;  // use IPv4 or IPv6, whichever
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
    hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // fill in my IP for me

    getaddrinfo(NULL, MYPORT, &hints, &res);

    // make a socket, bind it, and listen on it:

    sockfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);
    bind(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);
    listen(sockfd, BACKLOG);

    // now accept an incoming connection:

    addr_size = sizeof their_addr;
    new_fd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&their_addr, &addr_size);

    // ready to communicate on socket descriptor new_fd!
    .
    .
    .
```
- `their_addr` will hold information about the incoming connection that we are `accept()`'ing
- `addr_size` will be set to `sizeof their_addr` and then inputted into `accept()`. That's all it does.
	- It uses `socklen_t` instead of `int`, `unsigned int`, etc. to remain a consistent size regardless of architecture.
- `sockfd` and `new_fd` will hold the returned socket descriptors from `socket()` and `accept()` respectively.
1. Declare aforementioned variables
2. Set up `listen()`
3. `their_addr` is initialized as a `struct sockaddr_storage` since `struct_sockaddr` isn't big enough to an IPv4 or IPv6 address, but `struct sockaddr_storage` is. Then, the bigger size is used for the 3rd argument in `accept()`. `accept()` will then read past the limits of the now `struct sockaddr` (inputted as the 2nd argument) to get the full address.
4. If only 1 connection is desired, you can `close()` the the listening `sockfd` at this point
>This function (and more below) commonly use a `struct sockaddr_storage` typecasted into a `struct_sockaddr` instead of using a `struct sockaddr_storage` directly probably because the smaller size was fine initially, but a bigger size was needed later, and changing it would cause problems.
# `send()` and `recv()`
Used for stream sockets or connected datagram sockets
>Here’s something that might (or might not) be new to you: these are _blocking_ calls. That is, `recv()` will _block_ until there is some data ready to receive. “But what does ‘block’ mean, already?!” It means your program is going to stop there, on that system call, until someone sends you something. (The OS techie jargon for “stop” in that sentence is actually _sleep_, so I might use those terms interchangeably.) `send()` can also block if the stuff you’re sending is all jammed up somehow, but that’s rarer. We’ll [revisit this concept later](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/slightly-advanced-techniques.html#blocking), and talk about how to avoid it when you need to.

```c
int send(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, int flags); 
```
- `sockfd` is the socket descriptor data will be sent to. Can be from `socket()` or `accept()`
- `msg` is a pointer to data that will be sent
- `len` is length in bytes of that data
- `flags` should be set to 0 usually
- Returns how many bytes were sent
- Returns `-1` on error and sets `errno`

Example code:
```c
char *msg = "Beej was here!";
int len, bytes_sent;
.
.
.
len = strlen(msg);
bytes_sent = send(sockfd, msg, len, 0);
.
.
. 
```
`len` and `bytes_sent` are 2 separate variables since the data might not have all been sent, especially if the data is too large. The 2 can be compared to know if all the data was sent. If not, more `send()` call(s) are needed. If the packet is small (around 1K bytes or less), it will probably send the whole thing

```c
int recv(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, int flags);
```
- `sockfd` is the socket descriptor to read from
- `buf` is the buffer to read the information to
- `len` is the maximum length of the buffer
- `flags` is set to 0 usually
- Returns the number of that make it into the buffer.
- Returns `-1` on error and sets `errno`

# `sendto()` and `recvfrom()`
Used with unconnected datagram sockets. Since datagram sockets aren't connected to a remote host, the destination address is needed to know where to send to.
```c
int sendto(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, unsigned int flags, const struct sockaddr *to, socklen_t tolen); 
```
- first 4 parameters are same as `send()`
- `to` points to destination info - IP address & port. It will probably be a typecasted `struct sockaddr_in` or `struct sockaddr_in6`
	- The destination address will come from `getaddrinfo()`, `recvfrom()`, manually packed, etc.
- `tolen` will be set to `sizeof *to` or `sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage)`. It uses `socklen_t` for the same reasons as the third parameter in `accept()` does
- Just like `send()`, returns the number of bytes actually sent and returns `-1` on error and sets `errono`

```c
int recvfrom(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags, struct sockaddr *from, int *fromlen); 
```
- first 4 parameters are the same as `recv()`
- `from` is a pointer to a local `struct sockaddr_storage` that will hold the port/IP address of the machine that sent the message.
	- `struct sockaddr_storage`  is used instead of `struct sockaddr_in` so that it can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
- `fromlen` should be initialized to `sizeof *from` or `sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage)`. After `recvfrom()` returns, `fromlen` will hold the length of the address actually in `from`
- Returns the number of bytes received or `-1` on error and sets `errno`

Remember, these 2 functions are for unconnected datagram sockets. If you `connect()` to a datagram socket, you can still use `send()` and `recv()`. The only difference between this and a stream socket is the packets use UDP.

# `close()` and `shutdown()`
```c
close(sockfd)
```
This closes the connection on the socket. Any further attempts to read or write to the socket on the remote end will receive an error (return `-1` and set `errno).

`shutdown()` can be used instead to cut of communication from a certain direction only.
```c
int shutdown(int sockfd, int how); 
```
- `how`
	- `0`: Further receives disallowed
	- `1`: Further sends disallowed
	- `2`: Further sends and receives disallowed (like `close()` but doesn't the socket descriptor)
- Returns 0 on success and `-1` on error and sets `errno`
This doesn't actually close the file descriptor - just changes its usability. `close()` still needs to be called to free a socket descriptor
>If you deign to use `shutdown()` on unconnected datagram sockets, it will simply make the socket unavailable for further `send()` and `recv()` calls (remember that you can use these if you `connect()` your datagram socket).(??)

>On Windows and Winsock, use `closesocket()` instead of `close()`

# `getpeername()`
Tells you who is at the other end of a connected stream socket.
```c
#include <sys/socket.h>

int getpeername(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, int *addrlen); 
```
- `sockfd` is your stream socket.
- `addr` is a `struct sockaddr*`. A `struct sockaddr_in*` works too.
	- `struct sockaddr_storage` doesn't work? why?
- `addrlen` should pointed to an int that is initialized to `sizeof *addr` or `sizeof(struct sockaddr)`
- Returns `-1` on error and sets `errno`
After getting their address, `inet_ntop()`, `getnameinfo()`, `gethostbyaddr()` can be used for more information

# `gethostname()`
Returns name of the computer a program is running on. The name can then be used by `getaddrinfo()` to get the IP address of the local machine.
```c
#include <unistd.h>

int gethostname(char *hostname, size_t size);
```
- `hostname` is a pointer to an array of characters that will contain the hostname upon the function's return.
- `size` is the length in bytes of the `hostname` array
- Returns `0` on success and `-1` on error and sets `errno`
