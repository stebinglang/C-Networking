(read intro for changes to files for Windows)
Computer Network: A set of computers sharing resources/information
- "resources" refers to many things like printers, Wi-Fi, etc.
	- E.g. using a phone hotspot to share Wi-Fi
Computer file: resource for recording data
Protocol: set of established rules/procedures for how to send/receive data between devices on a network

Everything in Unix is a file - network connection, pipe, terminal, etc. Each OPEN file has a **file descriptor** - an integer associated with an open file that is read from/written to. I.e. an ID for an open file. It doesn't change and the the integer doesn't mean anything.
ALL I/O is done through reading/writing to a file descriptor. This includes Network operations.
How to get file descriptor:
1. make call to `socket` system routine(?). This returns a socket descriptor
2. Communicate through socket descriptor using `send()` and `recv()` socket calls
Since this is just reading/writing to a file, `read()` and `write()` would work too, but `send()` and `receive()` are made for network operations, and can do more stuff

Types of sockets:
- DARPA Internet addresses (Internet Sockets)
- path names on a local node (Unix Sockets)
- CCITT X.25 addresses (X.25 Sockets that you can safely ignore)
- and more
This guide only deals with Internet Sockets

# 2.1 Two Types of Internet Sockets
1. Stream Sockets - `SOCK_STREAM`
2. Datagram Sockets - `SOCK_DGRAM`
	1. AKA connectionless sockets. But they can be `connect()`'d.
There are more, but this guide deals with two. Looking into Raw Sockets on your own is recommended
## Stream Sockets
- Reliable two-way connection - minimal errors.
- Outputs in the order data is inputted. E.g.:
	Input: 1, 2
	Output: 1, 2
### Used by
- Telecommunications network (`telnet`) - client/server application protocol that gives remote access to a system.
- Secure Shell (`ssh`) - a network protocol for secure remote login.
	- In CS400, `stevlia2019@146.148.87.228` was used to login to Virtual Machine. Then, it asked for a password to complete the login.
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - uses stream sockets to get web pages
	- used by web browsers

> if you telnet to a web site on port 80, and type “`GET / HTTP/1.0`” and hit RETURN twice, it’ll dump the HTML back at you!

## Why so reliable?
Stream sockets use protocol called the **Transmission Control Protocol** (TCP) - makes sure data arrives sequentially and error-free.
> TCP is sometimes called the better half of TCP/IP. IP stands for Internet Protocol - deals with internet routing and is not generally responsible for data integrity.

## Datagram Sockets
- Unreliable
	- A sent datagram may or may not arrive. If it arrives, it may be out of order, but the data will be error-free even if it is out of order
- Uses IP just like stream sockets do but not TCP. Instead, uses UDP.
- **Connectionless** - Stream sockets need to maintain an open connection. Datagram sockets just needs 2 things: packet and IP header. Then, they are just sent out.
	- packet - contains the data sent. i.e. the **payload**
	- IP header - has destination information
		- these 2 things make up an IP packet

Generally when TCP stack is unavailable or a few dropped packets is ok.
Used by:
 - `tftp` (trivial file transfer protocol)
 - `dhcpcd` (a DHCP client)
 - multiplayer games
 - streaming audio
 - video conferencing
For the last 3, data is commonly lost (low bitrate in video, lag, etc.). The dropped packets are ignored or there might be programming to compensate for them.

`tftp` and `dhcpcd` are used to transfer binary applications from one host to another, so it is not acceptable for data to be lost.
- a host here means any device on a network that has an IP address and can send/receive data. Phones, laptops, etc.
Thus, the `tftp` protocol will re-transmit the packet repeatedly until the sender gets an ACK(acknowledgement) packet. This process of checking for ACK packet is a protocol on top of the UDP protocol used to send the data.

### Why use an unreliable protocol?
Answer: Speed.
It is faster to send and forget than to keep track of what has/hasn't arrived and that the data is is correct, and w/e else TCP does to be reliable.
Online games, video calls, etc. don't mind some lost data in exchange for speed, but something like chat messages would prefer TCP to make sure the message went through.

Summary:
Stream Sockets use TCP. reliable.
Datagram Sockets use UDP. unreliable.

### 2.2 Data encapsulation and the Layered Network Model

![[Pasted image 20250214131646.png]]

[[2. What is a socket#Datagram Sockets|TFTP explained in last paragraph of this section.]]
Thus, the data is wrapped ("encapsulated") in a header (and rarely a footer) by the first protocol (e.g. the `tftp` protocol). Then, the whole thing (Data in `tftp` protocol) is wrapped by another protocol UDP. etc. Thus, all these protocols are used to send data to another computer.

When the other computer receives the packet:
1. The hardware strips the Ethernet header
2. The kernel strips the IP and UDP headers
3. The TFTP program strips the TFTP header
4. Finally, the data is accessible

the **Layered Network Model** (aka "ISO/OSI") is made up of the following layers:
- Application - where users interact with the network.
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Data Link
- Physical - hardware. (serial, Ethernet etc.)
This layers represent encapsulation. e.g. the Physical layer encapsulates all previous layers and sends out that data. This model is VERY general.
???
> This Network Model describes a system of network functionality that has many advantages over other models. For instance, you can write sockets programs that are exactly the same without caring how the data is physically transmitted (serial, thin Ethernet, AUI, whatever) because programs on lower levels deal with it for you. The actual network hardware and topology is transparent to the socket programmer.

A layered model of UNIX one might make could be:
- Application Layer (_telnet, ftp, etc._)
- Host-to-Host Transport Layer (_TCP, UDP_)
- Internet Layer (_IP and routing_)
- Network Access Layer (_Ethernet, wi-fi, or whatever_)

ppl say referral is important

ask about team structure with comparison to First Alert in mind
1. First Alert: 2 1-hr meetings a week to give tasks/ask questions. Is this how things are done at your company?
2. First Alert: Run tests on code and then peer review and submit pull req at the end. same at ur company?
3.
