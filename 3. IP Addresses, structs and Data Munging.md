# IP Addresses, versions 4 and 6
IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)
- used address of 4 bytes (32 bits)
	- four octets
	- used "dots and numbers" form
		- e.g. `192.0.2.111`
	- almost every website uses IPv4
Some big organizations allocated millions of IP addresses for their own use (Xerox, MIT, Ford, HP, IBM, GE, AT&T, Apple, etc.). But many devices need their own IP addresses, so in fear of running out, IPv6 was born.
IPv6
- 16 bytes (128 bits)
- two-byte chunks separated by a colon
	- e.g. `2001:0db8:c9d2:aee5:73e3:934a:a5ae:9551`
		- Each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits. Thus, a byte is 2 hex digits, so each chunk is  hex digits
How to compress IPv6 address:
- Leading 0s in each 2-byte chunk can also be omitted. If a chunk is `0000`, that can be changed to just `0`
- Consecutive 0s can be compressed with 2 colons. If there are multiple consecutive 0 sequences, choose the longest
	- e.g. `2001:0000:0000:0012:0000:0000:0000:0051` has 2 consecutive 0 sequences.
		1. Remove leading zeroes: `2001:0:0:12:0:0:0:51`
		2. Use 2 colons to compress the longest 0 sequence: `2001:0:0:12::51`
			- `2001::12::51` would be incorrect since then we don't know where `12` is. It could be in the 3rd , 4th, 5th, or 6th chunk.
	
The following pairs are equivalent)
```
2001:0db8:c9d2:0012:0000:0000:0000:0051
2001:db8:c9d2:12::51

2001:0db8:ab00:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
2001:db8:ab00::

0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
::1
```
**loopback address** - a unique set address that denotes the machine the code is currently running on.
- In IPv4, it's `127.0.0.1`
- In IPv6, it's `::1`

IPv4 addresses can be converted to IPv6 address by adding `::ffff` to the beginning of the IPv4 address.
e.g. `192.0.2.33` -> `::ffff:192.0.2.33`

many addresses in IPv6, just like IPv4, are reserved by people.

## Subnets
Subnet: a segmented piece of a larger network
The first 3 bytes of an IPv4 address is the **network portion** of the address. The last byte is the host byte.
e.g. `192.0.2.12`. Then, we would say...
- this is on host `12`
- this is on network `192.0.2.0`. Notice that the last byte is zero'd out.
In the past, the first 1 to 3 bytes of an IPv4 address was the network part. Then, remaining bytes were for the host. There are called "classes" of subnets.
The 3 classes:
- Class A: 1 byte for network. Last 3 for host.
	- If you were on this network, you could have $2^{24}=16,777,216$ hosts on this network.
- Class B: 2 bytes for network. Last 2 for host.
- Class C: 3 bytes for network. Last is for host. This is what was just discussed
Thus, there are far fewer Class A subnets than Class C subnets.

`255.255.255.0` is called the **netmask**. bitwise-AND it with the full IP address to get the network portion.
E.g. `192.0.2.12` AND `255.255.255.0` is `192.0.2.0`

Later, the number of network bits was allowed to be any number of bits since network addresses were running out. This required different netmasks such as `255.255.255.252` (30 bits for the network, 2 for host).
> `252` represents `11111100` in decimal. Then, the last 2 bits could represent the numbers `0` to `3`, which altogether adds to the maximum of `255`

To make things easier, the number of network bits could be denoted by a number after the IP address, separated with a slash. e.g. `192.0.2.12/30` means there are 30 network bits in the IPv4 Address.
IPv6 examples:
`2001:db8::/32`
`2001:db8:5413:4028::9db9/64`

Subnet definition: a segmented piece of a larger network. Each subnet can be described by the number of bits for the network portion of the IP address.

## Port Numbers
Port numbers are needed along with the IP address. Each port number is 16 bits and further specifies the address.
Analogy: IP address is like the street address of a hotel and the port number is the room number.
Examples of port numbers in Unix:
- port 80: HTTP(web)
- port 23: telnet
- port 25: SMTP
- port 666: used by DOOm game
Ports under 1024 are special and usually require special OS privileges to use.
[List of ports that specific services on the internet use](https://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers)
- e.g. you can see 23 is for Telnet

## Byte Order
Big-Endian: bytes in order they are read in.
	aka **Network Byte Order** since network uses this.
Little-Endian: bytes stored in reverse.

A computer's choice of little or big endian is its **Host Byte Order**. Different brands, models, etc. might make a different choice.
Always use functions to convert your computer's Host Byte Order to Network Byte Order. Even if your computer is already in Host Byte order. These functions work for the data types `short` and `long`. Signed and unsigned both work

The Functions:
`htons()` - host to network short. Converts a short from Host Byte Order to Network Byte Order. The rest should be self-explanatory.
`htonl()` - host to network long
`ntohs()` - network to host short
`ntohl()` - network to host long

Thus, always use first 2 functions to convert to Network Byte Order before they go "on the wire" and always use the latter 2 functions to convert to Host Byte order every time data comes "off the wire".

Numbers in the guide are in Host Byte Order unless specified otherwise.

## structs
Data types used by the socket's interface
- Socket descriptor is an int

### struct addrinfo
```c
struct addrinfo {
    int              ai_flags;     // AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME, etc.
    int              ai_family;    // AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_UNSPEC
    int              ai_socktype;  // SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM
    int              ai_protocol;  // use 0 for "any"
    size_t           ai_addrlen;   // size of ai_addr in bytes
    struct sockaddr *ai_addr;      // struct sockaddr_in or _in6
    char            *ai_canonname; // full canonical hostname

    struct addrinfo *ai_next;      // linked list, next node
};
```
- invented more recently(1999)
- **(delete/modify these notes if needed later after actually using it)
- preps socket address structures for subsequent use.
- used in host name lookups and service name lookups
- load this struct up a bit, use `getaddrinfo()` to get a pointer to a new linked list of these structures filled out
- `ai_family` decides if it uses IPv4 or IPv6. Set to `AF_UNSPEC` for it to use any. This makes the code IP version-agnostic. (works for both?)
- "`ai_next` points at the next element—there could be several results for you to choose from. I’d use the first result that worked, but you might have different business needs; I don’t know everything, man!"
- `ai addr` is a pointer to a `struct sockaddr`
- usually this is all filled out from `getaddrinfo()`, but we are learning this for when we need to look inside the struct
- "all the code written before `struct addrinfo` was invented we packed all this stuff by hand, so you’ll see a lot of IPv4 code out in the wild that does exactly that. You know, in old versions of this guide and so on."
Some `struct`s are IPv4 or IPv6 only.

### `struct sockaddr`
```c
struct sockaddr {
    unsigned short    sa_family;    // address family, AF_xxx
    char              sa_data[14];  // 14 bytes of protocol address
}; 
```
- `sa_family` can be set to many things, but in this document, it will be:
	- `AF_INET` for IPv4
	- `AF_INET6` for IPv6
- `sa_data` has destination address and port number for the socket. It is annoying to manually put data into `sa_data`, so programmers made `struct sockaddr_in`:

#### Parallel structure of `struct socaddr`
```c
struct sockaddr_in {
    short int          sin_family;  // Address family, AF_INET
    unsigned short int sin_port;    // Port number
    struct in_addr     sin_addr;    // Internet address
    unsigned char      sin_zero[8]; // Same size as struct sockaddr
};
```
- `sockaddr_in` is for IPv4
- `in` in `sockaddr_in` means "Internet." To be used with IPv4.
- a pointer to a `struct sockaddr` can be safely casted to a pointer to a `struct sockaddr_in` and vice versa.
	- Thus, you can do things like: `connect()` requires a `struct sockaddr*`. To use a `struct sockaddr_in` instead, just cast it in the call.
- `sin_family` corresponds to `sa_family`. It should always be set to `AF_INET`
- Then, instead of a `char` array, The information is easily accessible through the remaining variables.
	- `sin_port` must be in Network Byte Order - use `htons()`.
	- `sin_zero` exists to waste memory to match the size of a `struct sockaddr` . It should always be set to all zeros using `memset()`.
	- `sin_addr` is a `struct in_addr`. Which is:
	
```c
// Internet address (a structure is used for historical reasons)
struct in_addr {
    uint32_t s_addr; // that's a 32-bit int (4 bytes)
};
```
- `struct in_addr` used to be a union, but not anymore.
- `s_addr` references the 4-byte IP address in Network Byte Order
	- [[C#uint32_t|What is uint32_t?]]
	- Thus, if you had a `struct sock_addr_in` variable of the name `ina`, then you can access `s_addr` with `ina.sin_addr.s_addr`. Even if your system uses the union for `struct in_addr`, that doesn't change anything (due to `#define`s(??)).

## `struct` for IPv6
```c
// (IPv6 only--see struct sockaddr_in and struct in_addr for IPv4)

struct sockaddr_in6 {
    u_int16_t       sin6_family;   // address family, AF_INET6
    u_int16_t       sin6_port;     // port number, Network Byte Order
    u_int32_t       sin6_flowinfo; // IPv6 flow information
    struct in6_addr sin6_addr;     // IPv6 address
    u_int32_t       sin6_scope_id; // Scope ID
};

struct in6_addr {
    unsigned char   s6_addr[16];   // IPv6 address
};
```
- has an IP address and port number just like `struct sockaddr_in`
	- `struct sockaddr_in` had `sin_port` and `sin_addr`
- This guide does not explain this `struct` further
- is the parallel structure  of `struct sockaddr` but for IPv6(I think)

## `struct sockaddr_storage`
```c
struct sockaddr_storage {
    sa_family_t  ss_family;     // address family

    // all this is padding, implementation specific, ignore it:
    char      __ss_pad1[_SS_PAD1SIZE];
    int64_t   __ss_align;
    char      __ss_pad2[_SS_PAD2SIZE];
};
```
- is large(?) enough to hold IPv4 and IPv6 structures.
- For some calls(?), you don't know if your `struct sockaddr` will be filled with an IPv4 or an IPv6, so pass in(?) this parallel structure (very similar to `struct sockaddr` but larger) and then cast it to the type you need(?)
Check address family(?) in `ss_family` field. To repeat:
- `AF_INET` means IPv4
- `AF_INET6` means IPv6
Then cast it to a `struct sockaddr_in` or `struct sockaddr_in6` if desired
- I think those 2 structs only exist to make things easier and are not ever necessary to use

# More on IP Addresses

```c
// IPv4 example
struct sockaddr_in sa;
inet_pton(AF_INET, "10.12.110.57", &(sa.sin_addr));

// IPv6 example
struct sockaddr_in6 sa6;
inet_pton(AF_INET6, "2001:db8:63b3:1::3490", &(sa6.sin6_addr));
```
`10.12.110.57`  and `2001:db8:63b3:1::3490` are just random IP addresses
`inet_pton()`: converts an IP address in numbers-and-dots notation into a `struct in_addr` or a `struct in6_addr`. i.e. to binary.
- [[3. IP Addresses, structs and Data Munging#Parallel structure of `struct socaddr`|Why use a struct instead of an int?]]
- Those 2 structures are then used in `sa` and `sa6`
- First argument determines if it is an IPv4 or IPv6 address
- "pton" means "presentation to network"
- Returns `-1` on error. Returns `0` if address is messed up. Thus, implement error checking to make sure result is greater than 0.
- It translates the IP address into an `int` or `unsigned char` array by simply directly changing the IP address into a sequence of numbers with the dots removed.
> `inet_addr()` and `inet_aton()` were used instead in the past, but are now obsolete; neither works with IPv6. 

```c
// IPv4:

char ip4[INET_ADDRSTRLEN];  // space to hold the IPv4 string
struct sockaddr_in sa;      // pretend this is loaded with something

inet_ntop(AF_INET, &(sa.sin_addr), ip4, INET_ADDRSTRLEN);

printf("The IPv4 address is: %s\n", ip4);


// IPv6:

char ip6[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN]; // space to hold the IPv6 string
struct sockaddr_in6 sa6;    // pretend this is loaded with something

inet_ntop(AF_INET6, &(sa6.sin6_addr), ip6, INET6_ADDRSTRLEN);

printf("The address is: %s\n", ip6);
```

```c
const char *inet_ntop(int af, const void *src, char *dst, socklen_t size);
```
`inet_ntop()`: converts a binary IP address to numbers-and-dots notation. i.e. the opposite of `inet(pton)`.
- 1st argument decides IPv4 or IPv6
- 2nd argument is the address
	- It uses the `&` to access the address since this is more memory efficient. If it used the address directly instead, it would have to make a copy of the address to use in the function, which is not necessary
	- It is a `void*` since it expects:
		- a pointer to the `sin_addr` field of a `struct sockaddr_in` or...
		- a pointer to the `sin6_addr` field of a `struct sockaddr_in6`
- 3rd argument is a pointer to a string to hold the result
- 4th argument is the maximum length of the string
	- `INET_ADDSTRLEN` is a macro for the largest IPv4 string you'll need.
	- `INET6_ADDSTRLEN` is the same but for IPv6.

> `inet_ntoa()` was used instead in the past, but is now obsolete; doesn't work with IPv6

dellater:
> These 2 functions only work with numeric IP addresses - won't do nameserver DNS lookup on a hostname like `www.google.com`.  `getaddrinfo()` is for that.

# Bonus: Private (or Disconnected) Networks
You have an IP address assigned to you by your ISP. This is your **external (public) IP address**. Each device is then given its own IP address that is completely different. This is your **internal (public) IP address**.
e.g. your external IP address might be `192.0.2.33` while your internal IP address (router's internal IP address) might be `10.0.0.5`.
- `10.x.x.x` is one of few reserved networks that are only to be used on networks that are either fully disconnected or behind firewalls.
	- Networks behind firewalls don't have to be on a reserved network
- `192.168.x.x` is another common private network number.
> `192.0.2.x` is a format for fake IP addresses like the one mentioned.

> IPv6 has private networks too. They start with `fdXX` (and maybe `fcXX` in the future). IPv6 addresses usually don't use NAT unless doing IPv6 to IPv4 gateway. Also, with IPv6 addresses, NAT is not necessary since you already have so many more addresses.

This is useful since if all your devices had the exact same IP address data packets wouldn't know which to send to since they use an IP address as their destination.

A firewall can hide your internal IP address. A firewall will often translate your internal IP address to an external IP address using a process called **Network Address Translation** (NAT).
